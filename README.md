## Authentication

> âš The API documentation does **not specify any authentication** method such as API keys, OAuth, or tokens.

Assume:
- No authentication is required for public usage.
- If hosted on a platform (e.g., RapidAPI), follow the platform's authentication guide.

## Error Handling

Although not fully documented, expect common HTTP status codes:

| Code | Meaning               | Suggested Action                  |
|------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 400  | Bad Request            | Check your query syntax or parameters |
| 404  | Not Found              | The title or ID doesn't exist     |
| 500  | Internal Server Error  | Retry after some time             |

### Handling Tips:
- Validate inputs before sending requests
- Wrap requests in try-catch blocks or use `.catch()` in JS
- Use fallback messages when data is missing
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for 5xx errors

##  Usage Limits and Best Practices
### Usage Limits
- Maximum of **50 results per page** using the `limit` query parameter.
- No specific rate limits documented, but avoid making rapid repeated requests to prevent throttling.

### Best Practices
- Use `mini_info` or `base_info` to reduce response size
- Paginate using `limit` and `page` for large queries
- Filter data using `genre`, `year`, or `titleType` to target specific results
- Use `/title/utils/lists` to display trending or top-rated content
- Batch-fetch titles with `/x/titles-by-ids` for efficiency
